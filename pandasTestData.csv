It begins with him speaking about how the Bush family was connected. Claims explosives were put in the building days before 9/11 but people working for the Bush family. When asked a reasonable question about where flight 77 is, if it did not crash into the Pentagon he can only give wild speculation. The second part begins with him speaking about the recently (2005) oral histories of 9/11 survivors.

His talk begins with someone giving a brief history of his life in activism. He begins talking about how the government wants to try and control weather and how he feels about it. This talk is just him sharing his thoughts on many topics including weather control, Vietnam, the military, politics, college, organization, America, genocide in America. All of this leads up to his assertion that the next step in the military industrial complex is now defunding education and clear air/water programs to begin funding aerospace war, which he sees as the next big war. The speech cuts 4 minutes before the recording ends and then includes segments of the post speech Question and Answer session.","This audio is property of The KBOO Foundation and may include additional rights holders.

The speech starts with someone telling a personal story about how they became familiar with Ross Gelbspan's writings. Gelbspan begins by talking about how the global economy can become stagnant and how the more reliable path to getting out of it would be global works programs. Which he says will lift off the economy within a decade. He then turns to talking about planet heating and how it is getting hotter and hotter. He wants to replace everything that hurts the climate with climate emission responsible products, including heaters and cars. He continues to speak about temperature change and how it effects the globe and how it can affect the economy in the decades to come. Says that some politicians tried to use science to convince older and less educated people that climate change was not true. Says that outside of the U.S. there is little to no debate on climate change. He talks about the U.S. pulled out of Kyoto Accord when Bush took office because they did not see it as fair to first world countries. His dad originally signed the agreement. Believes the time is right to try and reduce climate change, says we have all the allies we need but the time to act is rapidly decreasing and we need to act fast. Gelbspan's talk end with a Q&A, which is very quiet on the Q end.",,KBOO Archives Room,Minidisc,,,,stereo,Non-Saleable,,stereo,44.1 kHz,16 bits,,01:03:27,,,,,,,kboo_MD-156_20041005.wav,,641 MB,64A6A885401F29C3B5BE6AED0A62A9B5,,,kboo_MD-156_20041005.mp3,,,,,United States,,

He discusses torture tactics practiced in Latin America and the 'culture of fear' that it creates in communities. Living in Eugene, Nieto-Maquehue works with refugees escaping political violence in Latin America. The conference was held August 8 - 10, 2003 at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Break the Chains Conference planners stated the following vision: 'We are organizing this conference to educate people about the bleak reality of the prison crisis, to mobilize people from the anti-repression, prisoner-support and anti-capitalist movements, to humbly host like-minded activists from other regions in what we hope is to be an extremely powerful and productive convergence, to learn from survivors of the prison system and gain from them invaluable lessons about the nature of the beast we are up against, and to begin the difficult task of developing a cohesive, organized, diverse, and effective movement against state repression and the politics of mass imprisonment. As the ruling elite intensifies its repression more & more broadly, such a movement becomes necessary now more than ever before.'","This audio is property of The KBOO Foundation and may include additional rights holders.

Robbins begins speaking right off the bat, beginning with how his daughter in law gave birth to premature twins who needed round the clock care. Including Kangaroo care and how the hospital referred to them as miracle babies. Then starts speaking about how food gives you the energy to do what you love and how in every culture eating with others can lead to peace-making. Other topics include meat based diets, how bad the living conditions of animals are, how people should protect animal rights, weather disturbances/ climate change and how it affects how food is produced. People need to switch to a plant-based diet. He later talks about Monsanto and how we as people are not yet evolved enough to eat genetically modified food and how they should be labeled. He later details his episode of 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' and how weird it was.","This audio is property of The KBOO Foundation and may include additional rights holders.

Recorded in Provincetown, MA on August 23, 1998. Once corporations got a foot in the door to power in the late 1890s, it took less than a century to buy the whole building and the ground it stands on. Corporate dominance of the public sphere and its growing presence in our private lives are increasingly viewed as simply the way things are--it's just business. When corporate power is challenged by public advocates and small grassroots efforts, they often find themselves up against the goliathan might of money and big media. In this interview, Grossman provides a historical context for legal and civil disobedient resistance to corporate power and discusses late-1990s efforts to defend the commonweal.
